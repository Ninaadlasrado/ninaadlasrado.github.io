Abstract:
Viral myocarditis has been identified as a major cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that can lead to heart failure. Historically, Coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses have been commonly suspected in myocarditis/DCM patients in North America and Europe. However, this notion is changing as other viruses such as Parvovirus B19 and human herpesvirus-6 are increasingly reported as causes of myocarditis in the United States, with the most recent example being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causing the Coronavirus Disease-19. The mouse model of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis, which may involve mediation of autoimmunity, is routinely used in the study of immune pathogenesis of viral infections as triggers of DCM. In this review, we discuss the immune mechanisms underlying the development of viral myocarditis with an emphasis on autoimmunity in the development of post-infectious myocarditis induced with CVB3.
