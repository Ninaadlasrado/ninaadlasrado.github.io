I am a [MassCPR](https://masscpr.hms.harvard.edu/) Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with [Dan Barouch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Barouch) in the [Barouch Lab](https://cvvr.hms.harvard.edu/lab/barouch-laboratory/) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of Harvard Medical School, where I primarily develop novel thermostable RNA vaccine platforms for mucosal delivery. I completed my PhD in the Integrative Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the mentorship of [Dr. Jay Reddy](https://jayreddy.unl.edu/research), where I worked on the development of novel vaccines for viral myocarditis and type-1 diabetes caused by various viral agents such as Coxsackievirus-B3 and Coxsackievirus-B4, respectively.

Research Interests:
======
Driven by a passion for global health equity, my work focuses on developing accessible and effective vaccines against infectious diseases. This builds upon my prior experience in viral vaccinology, including developing novel vaccine strategies for viral diseases like myocarditis and type-1 diabetes. At Harvard Medical School, I engineer next-generation RNA vaccines, particularly for respiratory and enteric pathogens, with an emphasis on overcoming cold-chain limitations. My research spans mucosal immunology,  AI-guided vaccine design, and pandemic preparedness, including developing vaccines for emerging threats.  I also explore novel vaccine strategies for sexually transmitted infections. Ultimately, I strive to create impactful immunizations for all, regardless of resources.
