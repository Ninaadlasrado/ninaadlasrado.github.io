I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Barouch Lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School. I completed my PhD in the Integrative Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the mentorship of [Dr. Jay Reddy](https://jayreddy.unl.edu/research), a distinguished Professor in the field of T-cell Immunology. 

Research Interests:
======
My graduate research revolved around the development of novel vaccines for viral myocarditis and type-1 diabetes caused by various viral agents such as Coxsackievirus-B3 and Coxsackievirus-B4, respectively. I used single-cell RNA-seq to study the transcriptomic changes that occur during the post-infectious autoimmune myocarditis phase. In addition to this, I also worked on the concept of trained immunity in the prevention of viral myocarditis and pancreatitis.
