I am a PhD student in the Integrative Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am currently pursuing my graduate education under the mentorship of [Dr.Jay Reddy] (https://jayreddy.unl.edu/research), a distinguished Professor in the field of T-cell Immunology. 

Research Interests:
======
My research interest revolves around the development of novel vaccines for autoimmune myocarditis and type-1 diabetes caused by various viral agents such as Coxsackievirus-B3 and Coxsackievirus-B4, respectively. I am developing a vaccine candidate that can offer cross-protection against multiple serotypes of Coxsackieviruses. I am also interested studying the trascriptomic changes that occur during the viral autoimmune myocarditis phase, for which I are performing the single-cell transcriptome analyses. I also work on developing transgenic mouse models to study autoimmune myocarditis. In addition to this, I am working on developing novel subunit vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 using biodegradable-nanoparticles.
