I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Barouch Lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School. I completed my PhD in the Integrative Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the mentorship of [Dr. Jay Reddy](https://jayreddy.unl.edu/research). 

Research Interests:
======
My current research focuses on developing the next generation of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics to combat infectious diseases. My work also focuses on elucidating the innate and adaptive mechanisms of action of mRNA vaccines, and the development of a pan-coronavirus and pan-sarbecovirus vaccine. My graduate research revolved around the development of novel vaccines for viral myocarditis and type-1 diabetes caused by various viral agents such as Coxsackievirus-B3 and Coxsackievirus-B4, respectively.
