I am a PhD student in the Integrative Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am currently pursuing my graduate education under the mentorship of [Dr.Jay Reddy](https://jayreddy.unl.edu/research), a distinguished Professor in the field of T-cell Immunology. 

Research Interests:
======
My research interest revolves around the development of novel vaccines for autoimmune myocarditis and type-1 diabetes caused by various viral agents such as Coxsackievirus-B3 and Coxsackievirus-B4, respectively. I use single-cell RNA-seq to study the trasncriptomic changes that occur during the viral autoimmune myocarditis phase. I also work on developing transgenic mouse models to study autoimmune myocarditis. In addition to this, I am also working on developing biodegradable-nanoparticles based novel subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
